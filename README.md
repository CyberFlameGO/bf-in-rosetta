# bf-in-ressota
Brainfuck interpreter in every launguge. Beacuse yes.
## <b>TAKE YA PICK</b>
### Currently complete languages
- #### Rust
    Proberly the fastest interpreter in existence, it's optimized beyond reason. It's so fast, it can easily overflow a 64bit number 500 times over in a second with our example program. Don't even think about running unchecked BF code on it beacuse it will give you an error how the Cached_data multex is poisened which caused a panic on the main thread beacuse you misplaced a bracket.
- #### Python
- #### C++
- #### Scratch
- #### PHP
    Can be found [Here](http://brainfucked.qrl.nz) or [at Github](https://github.com/LaSpruca/brainfuck-php) as a part of another project.
- #### Java
- #### C#
- #### Go
- #### TypeScript
    Specifically made to be incompatible with Javascript
- #### R
    In case you want to plot the output for some reason.
- #### Flutter App

### In progress languages
- #### Ruby

### Languages that were abanadend for mental health reasons
- #### B 
    Devlopment stoped beacuse we could not find a working compiler that both compiled and not get rid of random varibles in the program (Flash backs intensify).

## <b>THE EXAMPLE BF</b>
Custom code based on the superior decimal output flavor of BF.
